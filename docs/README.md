# Documentation

Use this page as the entry point for project documentation. The root
[README](../README.md) covers installation and the shortest path to a running
local application; the pages below explain design decisions and ongoing work.

## Start Here

1. [Application architecture](architecture.md) explains workspace boundaries
   and the browser-to-database request flow.
2. [Developer experience](developer-experience.md) covers generators, fast
   feedback commands, and template qualification.
3. [Template readiness](template-readiness.md) lists the capabilities to retain
   or deliberately remove when adapting the template.

## Development

- [OpenID Connect authentication](authentication.md): provider registration,
  local identity provider, token validation, and application authorization.
- [Database operations](database-operations.md): migration order, backups,
  restore verification, and failure recovery.
- [SST local testing](sst-local-testing.md): what can be validated without SST
  sign-in or AWS credentials.
- [Test operations](testing-operations.md): test layers, external test
  environments, and flaky-test policy.

## Deployment and Operations

- [Deployment and supply-chain security](deployment-security.md): GitHub OIDC,
  protected environments, security checks, and response headers.
- [Incident runbook](incident-runbook.md): triage, mitigation, recovery, and
  observability integration points.
- [Semantic versioning](semantic-versioning.md): release impact and repository
  version policy.

## Engineering Conventions

- [Git, branches, commits, and releases](conventions/git.md)
- [Monorepo operations](conventions/monorepo.md)
- [Testing policy](conventions/testing.md)
- [tRPC router convention](conventions/trpc.md)
- [TypeScript, imports, exports, constants, and types](conventions/typescript.md)
- [AI collaboration convention](conventions/ai.md)

## AI Context

- [AI memory](ai-memory.md) is a compact repository map for coding agents. It
  supplements the engineering conventions and does not override them.

## Document Boundaries

- Put setup commands and the first successful local run in the root README.
- Put stable engineering rules under `docs/conventions/`.
- Put operational procedures in a dedicated top-level page under `docs/`.
- Update both the implementation and its canonical document in the same PR.
- Link to the canonical page instead of copying procedures into multiple files.
