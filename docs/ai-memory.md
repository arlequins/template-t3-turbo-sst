# AI Memory

This page is a durable context note for AI agents working in this repository.

## Repository Identity

- This is a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo template with SST, web, API, batch, database, and shared package layers.
- Internal packages use the `@acme/*` scope.
- The repository is private-template oriented by default. Internal packages should remain private unless a publication workflow is intentionally added.
- Documentation should avoid project-specific names from source material and should be written in English.

## Stack Memory

| Package manager | pnpm, with versions centralized through `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalogs.                     |
| Monorepo runner | Turborepo. Root scripts delegate to `turbo run` or `turbo watch`.                           |
| Frontend        | Next.js App Router, React, Tailwind CSS, and tRPC client.                                   |
| API             | Hono HTTP runtime with a tRPC server, local Node entry, and AWS Lambda entry.                |
| Batch           | SST Step Functions, Lambda handlers, EventBridge schedules, and local batch runner scripts. |
| Database        | Drizzle ORM with `postgres.js`.                                                             |
| Validation      | Zod, mostly through shared validator packages.                                              |
| Environment     | Centralized environment validation through `@acme/env` and SST bootstrap tooling.           |
| Tooling         | Biome plus shared Tailwind and TypeScript packages under `tooling/`.                        |

## Coding Memory

- Use named imports and named exports.
- Avoid TypeScript `enum`; use `as const` objects and derived value types.
- Prefer `type` over `interface`, unless declaration merging or external APIs require `interface`.
- Separate type-only imports with `import type`.
- Assume strict TypeScript settings, including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.
- Use `workspace:*` for internal dependencies unless an existing package intentionally uses a different workspace range.
- Add external dependency versions to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalogs before referencing them from package manifests.

## Architecture Memory

- tRPC routers should stay thin and delegate behavior to usecase wrappers.
- Business logic should live in services and depend on ports rather than concrete I/O.
- Drizzle queries belong in database adapters, not in routers.
- External API calls belong in external adapters, not in routers.
- Environment access should be centralized through `@acme/env`.
- Tests should start with pure shared packages and use Vitest.
- Database schema changes require committed Drizzle SQL and metadata; applied seed files are immutable.
- Browser authentication uses Authorization Code + PKCE; APIs validate JWT access tokens against OIDC discovery and JWKS metadata.
- `@acme/oidc-mock` is development-only and must not be deployed as a production identity provider.
- E2E tests own an isolated PostgreSQL container and must clean it up after the run.

## Review Memory

Before proposing a PR or final answer:

1. Confirm `git status --short --branch`.
2. Summarize changed files.
3. Report verification commands and results.
4. Mention any checks that were skipped.
5. Keep the PR body concise and focused on behavior, docs, and verification.
