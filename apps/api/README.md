# Hono API

The API exposes a lightweight health endpoint and the tRPC transport used by the static Next.js client.

```bash
pnpm --filter @acme/api dev
pnpm --filter @acme/api test
pnpm --filter @acme/api sst:deploy
```

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health/live` | Process liveness and request ID. |
| `GET /health/ready` | Readiness, including PostgreSQL connectivity. |
| `GET /health` | Compatibility alias for liveness. |
| `GET /docs` | Interactive Scalar API reference and request client. |
| `GET /openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.1 contract used by the API explorer. |
| `POST /api/echo` | Executable JSON request example for local and deployed verification. |
| `/api/trpc/*` | tRPC queries and mutations. |

Open `http://localhost:5000/docs`, select an operation, and use the request
client to send it to the current API host. The explorer persists authorization
locally so protected HTTP operations can reuse a bearer token when they are
added. tRPC procedures keep their TypeScript router contract and are not
represented as REST operations in the OpenAPI document.

`src/app.ts` is runtime-independent. `src/dev.ts` serves it with Node for local development, and `src/lambda.ts` adapts the same app to AWS Lambda.

## AWS deployment presets

Set `API_DEPLOYMENT_PRESET` before running `pnpm --filter @acme/api sst:deploy`.

| Preset | Best fit | Throttling | WAF | Custom domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `function-url` (default) | Internal APIs, prototypes, and low-traffic services that favor minimum cost and configuration | No API-level throttle. Use reserved concurrency or application controls. | Set `API_WAF_ENABLED=true` to add an SST Router backed by CloudFront and WAF. | `API_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` adds the same Router edge layer. |
| `api-gateway` | Public APIs that need managed access logs, route controls, and request throttling | `API_THROTTLE_RATE_LIMIT` and `API_THROTTLE_BURST_LIMIT`; defaults are 100 and 200. | API Gateway HTTP APIs do not accept the template's direct WAF option. Add CloudFront/WAF in front or use a REST API when direct API Gateway WAF association is required. | `API_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` configures the API Gateway domain directly. |

Examples:

```dotenv
# Direct Lambda Function URL
API_DEPLOYMENT_PRESET=function-url

# Function URL behind CloudFront, WAF, and a Route 53 domain
API_DEPLOYMENT_PRESET=function-url
API_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=api.example.com
API_WAF_ENABLED=true

# API Gateway HTTP API with stage throttling
API_DEPLOYMENT_PRESET=api-gateway
API_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=api.example.com
API_THROTTLE_RATE_LIMIT=250
API_THROTTLE_BURST_LIMIT=500
```

The deployment rejects throttling on `function-url` and direct WAF on `api-gateway` so unsupported combinations do not silently produce an unprotected endpoint. CORS remains in Hono for identical local and AWS behavior.
